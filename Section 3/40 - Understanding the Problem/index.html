        v-if - conditional rendering.   The <p> is only rendered if the formula evaluates to true,
               so this is invisible unless the array length is zero.
               v-if must point to a true/false value, but it can be a variable, method, computed etc.
        
        v-show - there is an alternative called v-show.   It doesn't have the else, else-if
               functionality and so is single use.   v-if adds or removes the html, v-show just
               turns the display on/off.   Use v-show if visibility changes a lot as quicker.
      -->
      <p v-if="goals.length === 0">No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!</p>
      <!--
        v-else must follow directly after a v-if statement and it is like a typical if statement
        This section of code will display one or the other.
        There is also a v-else-if="" statement that can be used to conditionally display html
      -->
      <ul v-else>
        <!--
          Here we use a v-for (for loop) go go through the array.
          Can use goal of goals (more javascript'ish), but generally use in
        -->
        <li v-for="goal in goals">{{ goal }}</li>
      </ul>
