      <!--
        Here we are associating a click event with a box via v-on or @ to
        the boxSelected function.   We also bind (v-bind or :) a style
        using a special format.   css is normally border-color, but we
        use a special camel case format with a ternary operator (if then)
      -->
      <div class="demo"
          :style="{borderColor: boxASelected ? 'red' : '#ccc'}"
          @click="boxSelected('A')">
      </div>
      <!--
        Here we have defined an active css class.   We bind to class and use
        a special format.   demo is always a class as it is set to true, but
        active is part of the class based upon the javacript variable
        boxASelected.   Much more readable.
      -->>
      <div
          :class="{demo: true, active: boxBSelected}"
          @click="boxSelected('B')">
      </div>
      <!--
        This is the final and best format.   We have a standard class which
        specifies classes that are part of it and do not change.   We then
        bind another class using :class with dynamic styling
      -->
      <div
          class="demo"
          :class="{active: boxCSelected}"
          @click="boxSelected('C')">
      </div>
      <!--
        With this one, we use a computed function to add classes, useful for
        more complex problems.
        Not a must do unless have very complex styling.
      -->
      <div
          class="demo"
          :class="boxDClasses"
          @click="boxSelected('D')">
      </div>
      <!--
        There is also an array syntax for defining which classes are included:
      -->
      <div
          :class="['demo', {active: boxESelected}]"
          @click="boxSelected('E')">
      </div>
    </section>
