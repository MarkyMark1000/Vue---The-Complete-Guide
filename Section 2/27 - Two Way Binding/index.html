        This is a common experience, where you want the input to adjust
        the value of a variable, but you also want the value of the
        input box to reflect that value.
        This is a concept called 2-way binding.   It has a shortcut method
        called v-model used with v-bind, and is shown in the next 2 input
        boxes, which do the same thing.
      -->
      <input type="text" v-bind:value="name" v-on:input="setName">
      <input type="text" v-model="name" v-bind:value>

      <button v-on:click="resetInput">Reset Input</button>

        He showed an example using a function to add the surname to the name
        here using a function outputFullName(), but the problem with this is
        whenever the other buttons are pressed, this function also runs, which
        is inefficient.    Using functions to display output within the html
        is inefficient.
      -->
      <p>Your Name: {{ outputFullName() }}</p>
      <!-- NOTE: no closing brackets -->
      <p>Your Name: {{ fullname }}</p>

        Video 29 is really worth re-watching.
        It is better to use computed properties whenever you are outputting
        something to the screen, unless you specifically want the function
        to recalculate whenever something changes on the screen.
        It is better to use methods for things like events.

      <!--
        Good Summary on Methods, Computed and Watchers:
        Methods:
          - Use with event or data binding, but is recalculated for every
          re-render cycle of the component.   Useful for 'events' OR 'data'
          that really needs to be re-evaluated all of the tmie.
        Computed:
          - Use with data binding.   They are only called when one of their
          used values changes.   Useful for data that depends upon other
          data.
        Watch:
          - Not used directly within the template and is useful for non-data
          updates.   It allows you to run code based upon some changed data.
      -->

        Important shortcuts:
          @click is the same as v-on:click
          :value is the same as v-bind:value
