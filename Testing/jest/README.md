## NOTES
---

When setting up a project using ```vue create someapp```, it is possible to select manual setup.   Within this
section include ```Unit Testing``` and then select ```Jest```.

This installs the following:
- Jest
- Vue CLI Unit Jest Plugin
- Vue-Jest
- Vue Testing Utilities

It also creates the following:
  tests/unit - directory for tests
  jest.config.js - config file for jest

Unit test file names must be similar to the following:
- name.spec.js
- name.spec.ts          // typescript tests
- name.test.js
- name.test.ts          // typescript tests

NEXT STEP - CREATE A PROJECT CALLED example_app_built_with_tests USING THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE VIDEO AND THEN
COMPARE THE DIRECTORIES AND WHAT IS REQUIRED TO SET THIS UP AFTER CREATING A PROJECT.
